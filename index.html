    <p>Meet Finn! Finn came to us as a scared, timid boy who came off of the streets but 
    has blossomed over time into a sweet, loving dog. Finn is a great, mellow medium-sized
    dog who'd be a wonderful, loyal companion for someone looking for a dog who will stick 
    by your side and go on long walks and hikes with you. Finn loves the outdoors and is 
    super curious about the world. His sweet nature makes him a great fit for someone with 
    another dog as well, since he can get along great with other dogs! Finn is eligible to be 
    taken home on a trial period so you can really see his beautiful personality grow and come 
    out! He's patiently waiting for his forever home.</p>
